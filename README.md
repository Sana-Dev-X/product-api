# Product API

-**Summary:**
  The idea here is to create an API using Spring and insert some functions and business rules.
  This project has no deadline and is for student purposes only.

-**Technologies:**
  Java
  Spring Framework
  HTML
  CSS
  MySQL
  Docker
  Postman

-**Current status:**
  On hiatus for now. I'll probably be back soon to add new features.
  I added the pages with the forms based on some research I did on JavaScript and it's working. 

-**Features:**
  Creation, display, updating and deletion of products;
  Records in databases;
